- **Detailed Specifications**: Track dimensions, materials, and build styles
- **Vault Plate Support**: Special handling for ferrules with vault plates
- **Process Documentation**: Record machining steps and assembly procedures
- **Firebase Integration**: Cloud storage with real-time synchronization
- **Offline Support**: Works with browser storage when Firebase isn't configured
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface with dark mode support
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes sync instantly across devices

## Getting Started

### Quick Start (Browser Storage)

1. Install dependencies:
