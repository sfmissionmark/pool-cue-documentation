A comprehensive documentation system for pool cue components built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This application allows you to document specifications, build processes, machining steps, and assembly notes for various pool cue components.

## Features

- **Component-based Documentation**: Organize documentation by cue components (Ferrules, Tips, Shafts, Joints, Butts, Wraps)
- **Detailed Specifications**: Track dimensions, materials, and build styles
- **Process Documentation**: Record machining steps and assembly procedures
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface with dark mode support
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes are immediately visible as you work

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.
